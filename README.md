## Overview
This repository contains mini-projects created as part of my learning journey with Arduino. The project involves basic Arduino programming and hardware integration to build a small-scale interactive system.

## Dependencies
To run the project, you'll need the following:
- Arduino IDE (available at https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
- Arduino hardware(This is not required to run the code, but is recommended for hand-on learning experience.)

## Conclusion
This project serves as a practice exercise to learn and understand the basics of Arduino programming and hardware integration.
